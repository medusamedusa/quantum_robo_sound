# quantum_robo_sound


This repository contains:
- (Jupyter Notebook) code for a quantum-driven toy robotic swarm moving on the xy-plane and xyz-space with sound output;
- PDF of the code in the considered cases in 2- and 3-dimensional motion;
- sound output as chord progressions in thr 2- and 3-dimensional case;
- a video of 3-dimensional motion with sound output.
